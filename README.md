## 📋 How It Works

1. **Input Text**: Provide a news article or text to the model.
2. **Tagging**: The model processes the text and assigns probabilities to each category.
3. **Results**: Receive the output with detected tags and their associated probabilities.
4. **Integration**: Use the output to categorize or analyze news content as needed.
